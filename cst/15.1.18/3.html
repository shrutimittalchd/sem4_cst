	So many days in my life I have just stared at the darkness of night sky wondering what the hell I am doing and whether anything will work out or go my way and whether I will ever live my dreams. 
	<hr>

I've been down and out, I've taken many hits along the way, I've suffered many failures and been the victim of my own mistakes, ego and immaturity more times than I care to mention.<hr size="5" width="100" align="left" noshade> Sometimes we go through times that just break our spirits and destroy us inside and no matter what you do, you can't find a way out because you just can't even see a way or find a way out of your situation and circumstances.

You aren't always going to get it right and I can assure you that most things won't go your way or fall into place when you all of a sudden want it to and this is especially true when you are pursuing your dreams and fighting for what you love and care about the most.

In many cases the only reason I'm still standing and why I've never folded or given up on my dreams and what my heart truly wants is because I know deep down inside that even though things haven't worked out or gone my way right now, it doesn't mean that they won't go my way and fall into place when the moment is right and as fate would have it, not a moment before you are ready.
